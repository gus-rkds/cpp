/*

Use code with caution. Learn more
This code first uses the seekg() method to set the current position in the file to the beginning of the file. Then, it uses the read() method to read the contents of the file at the current position into the Line struct. The contents of the line are then printed to the console.

Next, the code changes the second line to "This is new text." The length of the line is also changed to 15. The seekp() method is then used to set the current position in the file to the position of the second line. Finally, the write() method is used to write the contents of the Line struct to the file.

Once you have changed the code in this way, the error message should go away.
